				The Technical Documentation can quickly go from the use of the product, if you’re unfamiliar with that to the unedited transcript of everything the developer tells you about the application of the API. Both will get you using the product away, but in the different ways. One will simply tells you the use of the product, other will make you go cross eyed.

				Every plan starts with the research. It might sound obvious, but knowing the purpose and scope of your technical documentation will save you a ton of time and energy. If you’re not the subject matter expert, this might mean doing some internal interviews and building a relationship with the technical team to get a stronger grasp on the material. And this information goes on and on what’s called a documentation plan.

				The goal of the technical documentation is to be usable. And the huge part of that is making structurally logical and easier to navigate. Before, you even get into the creation of the content. You have to think that the content is going to be presented. This means thinking about both the page design, as well as the navigational structure of the document. Here the use of the templates and the schemes for the consistent on-page design.

				With the documentation plan and structure in the place, its time to get serious about creating the technical documents. Like any other written project, the easiest way to create the technical documentation plan is to follow the few steps rather than try to dive right in and start writing. The easiest way to make sure is that the thing you’re creating is useful, valuable and clear.

				Once your documentation is put together and live, it is the time that you get the real feedback for that. But this step gets skipped during the development of the technical documentation. But as we have said multiple times in this guide already, the technical documentation is all about the user. If that does not work for them, then it is considered a complete failure.

				At this point, you’re ready to push forward the documentation out in the world. But if you think that your job is finished then think of that again. Technical documentation is the living content that needs to be reviewed and bought up to date with the new product releases and updates.

				The Technical Documentation is not about capturing the information. It is all about the presentation that is easy to read, usable, and actually helpful for the audiences. The documentation is written by the technical expert who knows what they are talking about and are trained to translate the complicated product knowledge into the content that is more easily understood by the end-users. You need the technical writing team to prepare the technical documentation in a simpler way.

				The Technical Documentation assists the audiences to use the product, understand the product and get unstuck. Whether the audiences are the end-users, administrators, colleagues, or the technicians that really doesn’t matter a lot. The things that matter is that it is clear, searchable, and helpful for them. The simplest way is that you write the things that you know and think will help the users get the answers to their queries.

				The good Technical Documentation empowers the users, not frustrates them. It is an integral part of not just the client support, but the brand building and their trusts. Users seek to it when they are in the utmost need for this type of technical support. And when they do not find it there for them, they will definitely switch to the alternatives. The clear understanding of the information by the end-users is important here to keep them stick to your services.

				The Technical Documentation is the thing like the user-guide, release note, online help system, training programs, or operating procedures, etc that helps the users use the products. It is anything that is product-focused and is used to market your company like videos, presentations,  technical landing pages, etc. It could be technical and functional specification software development guides that will help the developers do their job.
